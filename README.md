# InboxApp

This is a sample app which displays a list of emails. For the simplicity a list emails are created locally.
The app uses Jetpack Compose for the UI implementation and it uses UI widgets like LazyColumn, SwipeToDismiss and also adds a touch of animation.

Following the book Practical Jetpack Compose by Joe Birch. https://practicaljetpackcompose.com/
